<p align="center">Niabi Zoo was founded in 1959, as a private zoo for people to see and enjoy exotic animals. Later purchased and deeded to the community by Patti S. Wiman, today the Zoo remains a destination to get up close to rare animals from around the world, but we are much, much more.

Niabi Zoo serves an education and conservation center that actively works with other programs on field conservation, coordinated breeding programs, and community education to make sure the incredible creatures we share this planet will stay part of the natural world for generations to come.
